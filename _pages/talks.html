* <a name="wikidatacon_2023"></a>**[WikidataCon2023, October 28-30]** Orange attended the WikidataCon2023 hybrid event and **Yann Almeras** presented [Supercharging Wikidata with External Aliases and New Entity Types](https://pretalx.com/wikidatacon2023/talk/MRZBDV/). Abstract:  Wikidata plays a crucial role in facilitating Named Entities Linking and Relations extraction for companies and researchers. However, it also faces certain limitations. Unlike DBpedia, Wikidata lacks a comprehensive taxonomy of entities, and many entities have a partial list of aliases that could benefit from enrichment. In this talk, we will introduce a database built within Orange that supplements Wikidata with enriched entity information sourced from various external databases using intelligent heuristics. Then we will show how this database can be used to highlight inconsistencies and poor-quality data in Wikidata and across various Wikipedia editions. We will also share our plans to develop robots to seamlessly transfer enhanced data back into the public Wikidata instance, fostering a more robust and accurate knowledge base.
