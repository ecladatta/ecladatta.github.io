TRIPLET Challenge 2025 @ 24th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2025), Nara, Japan
TRIPLET stands for TRIPLET Extraction from Triplet Text, Table, Knowledge Graph

## Task Description

Complementarity between tables, texts, and knowledge graphs and a joint knowledge extraction and reconciliation process constitute the focus of the ECLADATTA project.
Indeed, texts and tables may be related when presented in the same document or even across documents and complement each other.
For example, in the figure below, a Wikipedia page about a specific NBA team mentions that two basketball players were tested positive for COVID-19, while those names are missing in a summary table from another dedicated Wikipedia page. The date indicated in the Wikipedia table could nevertheless be used to correct or complete the Wikidata entries for the two players.
